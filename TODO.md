# //TODO
expressions:
- Add RangeExpression, which creates a range from minimum to maximum value (optionally with step)
- Add StringJoinExpression, which joins multiple values using a separator
- Add PadLeft and PadRight string expressions
- Add CreateObject expression, that creates an object (expando object) with multiple properties
- Add Coalesce/FirstNotNull expression, which maybe is just a short-hand for First with a predicate, but maybe is worth to have on its own
- Add expressions: IsOfType, IsNotOfType, IsNotNull, IsNull, IsNotEmptyString, IsEmptyString
- Add expressions: ConvertToInt, ConvertToDouble, ConvertToDecimal, ConvertToBoolean, ParseDateTime, ConvertToString
- Add expressions: Now, UtcNow, Today
