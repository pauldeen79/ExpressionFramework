# //TODO
expressions:
- Add aggregate expressions: Min, Max, First, Last, ElementAt, Count, Sum
- Add SequenceExpression, which evaluates all expressions, and returns them as a sequence.
- Add WhereExpression/FilterExpression, which filters expressions by conditions.
- Add OrderByExpression/SortExpression, which orders expressions.
- Add expressions for each operator on condition, so you can use these as an expression. e.g. EqualsExpression, NotEqualsExpression.
- Add expressions: IsOfType, IsNotOfType, IsNotEmpty, IsEmpty, ConvertToInt, ConvertToDouble, ConvertToBoolean, ParseDateTime, ToString, Coalesce/FirstNotNull
